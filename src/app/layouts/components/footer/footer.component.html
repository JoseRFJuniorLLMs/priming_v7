    matTooltip="Shadowing can be a very effective language learning technique, especially for beginners. It helps to familiarize the learner with the sounds and rhythms of the language, and can also help to build vocabulary and improve listening skills. It can be particularly useful for languages that have a different phonetic system than the learner's native language. The shadowing technique can be used in a variety of ways. Some people prefer to listen to a recording and repeat each sentence or phrase immediately after hearing it."
